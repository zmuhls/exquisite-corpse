**How about a game of exquisite corpse?**

### Background
Excerpted from the MoMALearning article [linked here](https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/tanguy-miro-morise-manray-nude/):
*Surrealist artists played a collaborative, chance-based parlor game, typically involving four players, called Cadavre Exquis (Exquisite Corpse). Each participant would draw an image (or, on some occasions, paste an image down) on a sheet of paper, fold the paper to conceal their contribution, and pass it on to the next player for his contribution.*

*For the Surrealists, Exquisite Corpse was a perfect parlor game, involving elements of unpredictability, chance, unseen elements, and group collaboration—all in service of disrupting the waking mind’s penchant for order.*
